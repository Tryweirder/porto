- net property: support external namespace
- test for log rotate
- a - empty, b - empty, c - command, start a/b/c
- ? respawn = true - respawn only if exit_status != 0
- ? porto_namespace -> namespace
- remove net_bps/net_ppsk
- portoctl top: dynamic field width (adjust to screen width)
- / and . containers
- fix container restoration: (try to) check if task is owned by porto
- add gc of dead containers with lost events
