- remember stop timestamp and cleanup dead periodically (every day)
- after container->Stop() returns, we have zombie process for some time (it will take a while for portoloop to reap it and deliver exit status to portod)
- remove extern AckExitStatus from container->Stop()
- porto support auto-respawning containers
- try to compile with clang and check warning

- stresstest: check for zombies, delivery queue overruns, fd leaks

# cleanup
- rotate subprocess stdout/stderr
- property:env support ; (via \;)
- move all 'extern "C"' into one file

# debug
- porto debug
- porto debug set container_kill_timeout 100000
