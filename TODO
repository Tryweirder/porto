- return EAGAIN from destroy/etc when can't wait for freezer
- PORTO_NAME - support namespaces
- top: use new get
- bind: follow links instead of realpath (fails when target doesn't exist)
- net property: support external namespace
- ? respawn = true - respawn only if exit_status != 0
- add gc of dead containers with lost events
- find and fix bug with meta-containers
- namespaces for volumes
- support volume as root
- custom SIGTERM timeout (allow to send SIGKILL for such containers so we can 'force-destroy' them)
- kill master when can't restart slave many times

# root property
- mount root loop in root namespace (to better diagnose possible problems)

# 3.18
- enable user namespace for virt_mode=os

# kernel
- ? kernel support for cgroup to limit allowed ports
- ? kernel support for cgroup coredump path

# volume api
- add stresstest
- allow non-empty destination dir if uid/gid matches
- create volume without tar.gz
- handle volume creation from chrooted containers
- merge ext4 quota management into volumes

# cleanup
- remove extern AckExitStatus from container->Stop()
- move all 'extern "C"' into one file
- use some kind of reference count for accounting running children
- add c++ namespaces
- ? get rid of globals/static which have class types (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#Static_and_Global_Variables)

# key-value refactor
- use one key-value storage for containers and volumes
- write to key-value using create-rename instead of merge
- repace uint16_t identifiers with something bigger
