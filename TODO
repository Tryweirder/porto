- after container->Stop() returns, we have zombie process for some time (it will take a while for portoloop to reap it and deliver exit status to portod)
- remove extern AckExitStatus from container->Stop()
- stresstest: check for zombies, delivery queue overruns, fd leaks
- ? semaphore to wait for a container
- ? do we support apps in non-leaf containers (unified hierarchy doesn't)
- ? memory_guarantee: do we need to check actual value in the sysfs

# phase 2
- cpu, network qos

# cleanup
- rotate subprocess stdout/stderr
- property:env support ; (via \;)
- move all 'extern "C"' into one file

# debug
- porto debug
- porto debug set container_kill_timeout 100000
